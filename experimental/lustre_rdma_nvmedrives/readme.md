# Lustre Infiniband

Visualisation: [config.json](https://azurehpc.azureedge.net/?o=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azurehpc/master/examples/lustre_Infiniband/config.json)

This is a deployment of Lustre using the available infiniband network. This solution has been designed to work with either IP over infiniband or true Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA) . The Object Storage Servers are designed to run a raid0 group using 1TB drives. This value can easily be changed inside installdrives.sh.

Please note that installdrives.sh does take some time to complete due to it having to work with only part of a virtual machine scale set (VMSS).

This deployment will only function using the Python based AzureHPC (not the BASH libexec).

Resources:

* Head node (headnode)
* Compute nodes (compute)
* Lustre
  * Management/Meta-data server (lfsmds)
  * Object storage servers (lfsoss)
  * Hierarchical storage management nodes (lfshsm)
  * Lustre client exporting with samba (lfssmb)

> Note: The HC nodes are used for the cluster, although this node type may be easily changed by use of the vm_type variable for lustre inside config.json.

The configuration file requires the following variables to be set:

| Variable                | Description                                  |

| resource_group          | The resource group for the project           |
| storage_account         | The storage account for HSM                  |
| storage_key             | The storage key for HSM                      |
| storage_container       | The container to use for HSM                 |
