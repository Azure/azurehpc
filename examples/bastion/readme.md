# Build a compute cluster with no public IP access, log-on using Azure Bastion

Visualisation: [config.json](https://azurehpc.azureedge.net/o=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azurehpc/master/examples/bastion/config.json)

This example will create an HPC cluster wth no public IP, you can log-in using Azure Bastion, from the Portal RDP to a Windows VM or ssh to a linux VM.
>Note: The config_no_pub_ip.json deploys an Azure Bastion, VNET and a jumpbox (no pub IP), then you can login to the jumpbox via the azure bastion and deploy the rest of your azurehpc deployment. The config_no_pub_ip.json contains an example of using cloud-init in AzureHPC. The AzureHPC prerequisites are installed on the jumpbox (with no public IP) using a cloud-init script (cloud-init.txt (Installs git, jq, AzureHPC git clone, azcopy and azcli). The Cloud-init script needs to be either uploaded to blob storage in advance or referenced in the config file by @cloud-init.txt (read-in directly).

## Initialise the project

To start you need to copy this directory and update the `config.json`.  Azurehpc provides the `azhpc-init` command that can help here by compying the directory and substituting the unset variables.  First run with the `-s` parameter to see which variables need to be set:

```
azhpc-init -c $azhpc_dir/examples/bastion -d bastion -s
```

The variables can be set with the `-v` option where variables are comma separated.  The output from the previous command as a starting point.  The `-d` option is required and will create a new directory name for you.  Please update to whatever `resource_group` you would like to deploy to:

```
azhpc-init -c $azhpc_dir/examples/bastion -d bastion -v resource_group=azurehpc-cluster
```

> Note:  You can still update variables even if they are already set.  For example, in the command below we change the region to `westus2` and the SKU to `Standard_HC44rs`:

```
azhpc-init -c $azhpc_dir/examples/bastion -d bastion -v location=westus2,vm_type=Standard_HC44rs,resource_group=azhpc-cluster
```

## Create the cluster with no public IP

```
cd bastion
azhpc-build
```

Allow ~15 minutes for deployment.  You are able to view the status VMs being deployed by running `azhpc-status` in another terminal.

## Log in the cluster

Connect to the linux headnode using Azure bastion service via ssh

You can login to a VM via bastion directly from your linux workstation using

```
bastion_ssh_bjumpbox.sh
```
>Note: You will need to edit this script to provide the BastionName, ResourceGroup, TargetResourceId, User and SshPrivateKey

You can also use the Azure portal to login to you VM via bastion, see below.

Locate the VM you want to connect to on the Azure portal and check "Connect".

Click the bastion option and login using your private keys.

![Alt text2](/examples/bastion/images/bastion_ssh.JPG?raw=true "Azure Bastion ssh")

Should now be on your linux headnode

Similarly, you can use Azure bastion to login to a Windows VM using RDP
