# Lustre Cluster

This is a full set up of Lustre using managed disks for the MDS and OSS Lustre servers, with all Lustre features available. The config.json file may be modified to handle between 2 and 10 disks per Object SStorage Server (OSS).

Resources:

* Head node (headnode)
* Compute nodes (compute)
* Lustre
  * Management/Meta-data server (lfsmds)
  * Object storage servers (lfsoss)
  * Hierarchical storage management nodes (lfshsm)
  * Lustre client exporting with samba (lfssmb)

> Note: The Hb nodes are used for the compute nodes of this cluster.  To get best performance nodes with accelerated networking should be used.

The configuration file requires the following variables to be set:

| Variable                | Description                                  |
