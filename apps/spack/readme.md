# Spack

[Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments. It was designed for large supercomputing center, where many users and application teams share common installations of software on clusters.

Spack will build and install software for HB, HBv2 or HC sku's with CentOS-HPC 7.7 (using the provided MPI libraries). See one of the examples for building a Cluster with HB or HC skus and PBS. (e.g. [simple_hpc_pbs](../../examples/simple_hpc_pbs/readme.md))


Copy apps dir to the headnode (to access spack build script from the headnode)
```
azhpc-scp -r $azhpc_dir/apps hpcuser@headnode:.
```


log-on to the headnode
```
azhpc-connect -u hpcuser headnode
```


Build/install spack using the build script.  This will install spack into /apps/spack and set-up some suitable defaults:
```
    build_spack.sh <SKU_TYPE> <EMAIL_ADDRESS> <STORAGE_ENDPOINT>
```
Where <SKU_TYPE> is hb, hbv2 or hc (used as sku identifier to indicate which SKU the software was built on), <EMAIL_ADDRESS> will be associated with the GPG key that is generated (used when accessing/downloading pre-built binaries from a build cache) and <STORAGE_ENDPOINT> is the storage account used to store the buildcache.

Example, building and installing osu-micro-benchmarks using different MPI libraries (from CentOS-HPC 7.7 image)

Using mvapich2
```
spack install osu-micro-benchmarks%gcc@9.2.0^mvapaich2@2.3.2
```
Using openmpi
```
spack install osu-micro-benchmarks%gcc@9.2.0^openmpi@4.0.2
```
Using hpcx
```
spack install osu-micro-benchmarks%gcc@9.2.0^hpcx@2.5.0
```
Using intel mpi 
```
source /opt/intel/impi/2019.5.281/intel64/bin/mpivars.sh
spack install --dirty osu-micro-benchmarks%gcc@9.2.0^intel-mpi@2019.5.281
```

Some example PBS scripts have been provided to show how run the osu-micro-benchmarks.
To run the osu bandwidth and latency tests using the openmpi version.
```
qsub -l select=2:ncpus=120:mpiprocs=1 osu_bw_openmpi.pbs
```

To add the built/installed osu-micro-benchmarks to a buildcache (i.e repository) on Azure blob storage
for later retrival and installation.

First, create a buildcache locally (e.g in home directory) and signed with gpg.
```
cd ~hpcuser
mkdir -p buildcache/${sku_type}
cd buildcache/${sku_type}
spack buildcache create -k ${sku_type}_gpg osu-micro-benchmarks%gcc@9.2.0^mvapich2@2.3.2
```

To see all available gpg keys
```
spack gpg list
```

Then use azcopy_v10 to upload the buildcache to blob storage.
```
azcopy sync "/share/home/hpcuser/buildcache" "<STORAGE_ENDPOINT>/buildcache<SAS_KEY>"
```

To set-up your blob storage as a buildcache location, you need to add a mirror.
```
spack mirror add ${sku_type}_buildcache ${STORAGE_ENDPOINT}/buildcache/${sku_type} 
```

To see what software is available for installation from the binary buildcache (blob storage).
```
   spack buildcache list
```

To install software available from the buildcache (blob storage).

```
   spack buildcache install <spec> or <hash>
```
